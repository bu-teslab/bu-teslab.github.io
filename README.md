  description: SSF estimates scattering coefficient and asymmetry parameter for dielectric particulate medium. Transport scattering coefficient is the proper metric for representing scattering regime. Solution of Maxwellâ€™s equations is possible for finite sized particulate media. Coherent scattering leads to overestimation of scattering coefficient. Calculated asymmetry parameter depends on considered ensemble size.
