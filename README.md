  image: imageaward_edited.png
  description: Necking and polydispersity in aggregate and monomer size are present in soot. Effects of these structures in soot on the scattering matrix are investigated. Impacts of necking and monomer polydispersity are mainly due to volume variation. Impacts on the phase matrix might be represented by variation in radius of gyration.
